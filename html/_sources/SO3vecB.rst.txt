SO3vec
******


An ``SO3vec`` object represents a general SO(3)-covariant vector, stored 
as a sequence of complex PyTorch tensors. 
Similarly to ``SO3part``, ``SO3vec`` also has a batch dimension. 

The `type` of an ``SO3vec`` is a list specifying the number of fragments in each of its parts. 
For example, the following creates a random ``SO3vec`` of type (2,3,1). 

.. code-block:: python

  >>> v=gelib.SO3vec.randn(1,[2,3,1])
  >>> v
  <GElib::SO3vecB of type (2,3,1)>
  >>> print(v)
  Part l=0:
    [ (0.132629,0.950553) (0.719683,1.16923) ]
   
  
  Part l=1:
    [ (-0.308873,1.34239) (-0.0749153,0.787603) (0.124809,-0.68182) ]
    [ (-0.395814,-0.452225) (-0.301379,-0.498362) (0.368224,0.251531) ]
    [ (1.73902,-0.423323) (-0.411957,0.293598) (-1.11078,-0.537569) ]
  
  
  Part l=2:
    [ (0.295592,-0.0414616) (1.63098,0.730143) (-0.0242692,0.707672) (0.771041,-0.809959) (0.763403,0.260789) ]
  

The batch dimension and type of an SO(3)-vector can be accessed as follows.

.. code-block:: python

 >>> v.getb()
 1
 >>> v.tau()
 [2, 3, 1]

The invidual parts are stored in the ``parts`` member variable

.. code-block:: python

  >>> print(v.parts[1])
  tensor([[[-0.3089+1.3424j, -0.0749+0.7876j,  0.1248-0.6818j],
           [-0.3958-0.4522j, -0.3014-0.4984j,  0.3682+0.2515j],
           [ 1.7390-0.4233j, -0.4120+0.2936j, -1.1108-0.5376j]]])

Fourier vectors
===============

As mentioned before, one context in which ``SO3vec`` objects appear is when computing the 
Fourier transform of functions on SO(3). In this case, however, all the ``SO3part``\s are square. 
Such ``SO3vec`` objects are created with the ``Fzero`` or ``Frandn`` constructors, which take only two 
arguments: the batch dimension and :math:`\ell_{\textrm{max}}`. 

.. code-block:: python

 >>> v=gelib.SO3vec.Frandn(1,2)
 >>> v
 <GElib::SO3vecB of type (1,3,5)>
 >>> print(v)
 Part l=0:
   [ (1.87611,-0.890737) ]

.. 
 In addition to all the operations that can be applied to generic ``SO3vec`` objects, Fourier ``SO3vec``\s 
 also support the ``Fproduct`` and ``Fmodsq`` operations.

================================
Diagonal Clebsch-Gordan products
================================

In the full CG-product, every fragment of ``u`` is multiplied with every fragment of ``v``, 
often leading to output vectors with very large numbers of fragments. In 
contrast, the ``DiagCGproduct`` function only computes the product between corresponding fragments. 
Naturally, this means that ``u`` and ``v`` must have the same type.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> w=gelib.DiagCGproduct(u,v)
  >>> print(w)

    [ (0.152031,-0.140948) (0.54849,-2.04492) (-1.24255,-0.815015) (-0.161307,-0.330928) ]

===================
Fproduct and Fmodsq
===================

If ``F`` and ``G`` are the Fourier transforms of two functions :math:`f,g\colon \textrm{SO}(3)\to\mathbb{C}` 
(represented as Fourier ``SO3vec`` objects),  
the Fourier transform of the product  :math:`h(R)=f(R)\,G(R)` can be computed directly from ``F`` and ``G`` 
using the formula 

.. math::
 H_\ell=\frac{1}{8\pi^2} \sum_{\ell_1} \sum_{\ell_2} 
 \frac{(2\ell_1 +1)(2\ell_2 +1)}{(2\ell +1)}~
 C_{\ell_1,\ell_2,\ell}^\dag (F_\ell \otimes G_\ell)\, C_{\ell_1,\ell_2,\ell}.

This operation is performed by the ``Fproduct`` function. 

``Fmodsq`` uses a similar formula to compute the Fourier transform of the squared modulus function 
:math:`h(R)=|f(R)|^2`. 

==============
GPU operations
==============


``SO3vec`` objects can be can moved back and forth between the host (CPU) and the GPU 
the same way as ``SO3part`` objects. 

.. code-block:: python

  >>> A=gelib.SO3vec.randn(1,[2,3,1])
  >>> B=A.to(device='cuda') # Create a copy of A on the first GPU (GPU0)
  >>> C=B.to(device='cpu') # Move B back to the host 

Similarly to the ``SO3part`` case, operations between GPU-resident ``SO3vec`` s are executed  
on the GPU and the result is placed on the same device.
