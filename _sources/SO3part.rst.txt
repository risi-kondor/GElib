SO3part
*******

An ``SO3part`` objects stores `n` different vectors transforming accoring to the same 
irreducible representation :math:`D^{(\ell)}`. 
Since :math:`D^{(\ell)}` is a :math:`2\ell\!+\!1` dimensional representation, 
the vectors can be jointly stored in a matrix :math:`\mathbb{C}^{(2\ell+1)\times n}`.   

The following constructs an ``SO3part`` object holding ``n=3`` vectors corresponding to the ``l=2`` 
irrep. 

.. code-block:: python

 >>> A=SO3part.gaussian(2,3)
 >>> A
 GElib::SO3part(l=2,n=3)
 >>> print(A)

The order ``l`` and multiplicity ``n`` of an ``SO3part`` is accessed as follows.

.. code-block:: python

 >>> A=SO3part.gaussian(2,3)
 >>> A.getl()
 2
 >>> A.getn()
 3
 

=====================
Access and arithmetic
=====================

 
``SO3part`` objects support the usual arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication 
by scalars, and so on. 

.. code-block:: python

 >>> A=SO3part.gaussian(2,3)
 >>> B=SO3part.gaussian(2,3)
 >>> print(A+B)

Individual entries in an ``SO3part`` can be accessed with the same syntax as how matrix elements are accessed. 
Note however the that indexing convention is that ``n`` index comes first, and the ``m`` index corresponding 
to indexing the components within a given irreducible vector is second. 

It is also important to note that in general manually setting entries in ``SO3part`` objects individually 
breaks equivariance. 

.. code-block:: python

 >>> A=SO3part.gaussian(2,3)
 >>> A(2,3)
 (1.4733880758285522+0.1949467808008194j)
 >>> A[2,3]
 (1.4733880758285522+0.1949467808008194j)
 >>> A[2,3]=1.0
 >>> print(A)
 [ (-1.23974,1.16493) (-0.407472,0.584898) (1.61201,-0.660558) ]

======================
Functions of SO3-parts
======================

Similarly to tensors, it is possible to take the inner products and norms of ``SO3part`` objects. 

.. code-block:: python

 >>> from GElib import *
 >>> A=SO3part.gaussian(2,3)
 >>> B=SO3part.gaussian(2,3)
 >>> inp(A,B)
 (1.5953152179718018+5.115486145019531j)
 >>> norm2(A)
 7.411661148071289


=================
Matrix operations
=================


``SO3part`` objects can also be multiplied by ``cnine::ctensor`` matrices from the `right`. 
Multiplication by matrices from the left is not allowed because it would break equivariance. 
Note that to construct ``cnine`` tensors, first the ``cnine`` module must be loaded.

.. code-block:: python

 >>> from GElib import *
 >>> A=SO3part.gaussian(2,3)
 >>> from cnine import *
 >>> M=ctensor.gaussian([3,3])
 >>> B=A*M
 >>> print(B)
 [ (6.03209,0.449935) (-0.717159,1.11423) (-4.45347,-1.60968) ]
 [ (-1.65973,0.693803) (1.65098,-1.79472) (2.36366,-1.61901) ]
 [ (-2.75144,0.117771) (1.33895,-3.43707) (9.36576,1.70359) ]
 [ (2.5369,3.65761) (-0.0298907,-0.733082) (-0.894675,-1.63206) ]
 [ (1.22471,-1.53125) (-1.74749,0.0933496) (-1.33813,1.35488) ]

===================
Spherical harmonics
===================


``SO3part`` objects can be initialized as spherical harmonic coefficients of a three dimensional vector 
correspnding to a given :math:`\ell`.  

.. code-block:: python

 >>> A=SO3part.spharm(2,[0.12,0.31,-0.55])
 >>> print(A)
 [ (-0.0764131,-0.0695855) ]
 [ (-0.123458,0.318933) ]
 [ (0.37763,0) ]
 [ (0.123458,0.318933) ]
 [ (-0.0764131,0.0695855) ]


=======================
Clebsch-Gordan products
=======================

The ``CGproduct`` function computes a single part (indexed by the last argument) 
of the part of Clebsch--Gordan product of two SO3-parts. 

.. code-block:: python

 >>> A=SO3part.gaussian(2,2)
 >>> B=SO3part.gaussian(2,2)
 >>> C=CGproduct(A,B,3)
 >>> print(C)
 [ (-1.99979,-0.121461) (-3.58782,2.10019) (-1.34679,-1.51318) (-2.83808,-0.352546) ]
 [ (1.14425,0.901388) (2.9222,0.910338) (-0.409205,0.741729) (-1.40359,1.8079) ]
 [ (-0.19909,-0.168839) (-3.0053,0.370446) (-0.0255721,0.566075) (-1.04462,-1.07568) ]
 [ (-0.149099,2.08319) (1.11618,0.282956) (-1.0153,0.660029) (1.42106,0.50812) ]
 [ (0.474459,-1.64466) (0.234653,0.618942) (0.828522,-0.762771) (-0.895682,0.300558) ]
 [ (-0.995215,0.783116) (0.885221,-0.726837) (-0.404905,-0.579419) (0.149155,0.764922) ]
 [ (-0.387969,-1.5089) (-0.163056,1.1043) (0.628268,-0.465748) (-0.576328,0.309953) ]
 

==============
GPU operations
==============


Similarly to ``cnine`` tensors, ``SO3part`` objects can moved back and forth between the host (CPU) 
and the GPU with the ``to`` method. 

.. code-block:: python

  >>> A=SO3part.gaussian(4,4)
  >>> B=A.to(1) # Create a copy of A on the first GPU (GPU0)
  >>> C=B.to(0) # Move B back to the host
